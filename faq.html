                <p class="question">I'm a water fanatic. I love water.</p>
                <p class="answer">This should make you happy. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.</p>
                <p class="question">We forget the trees get lonely too.</p>
                <p class="answer">Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. It's cold, but it's beautiful.</p>
                <p class="question">We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy.</p>
                <p class="answer">I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Don't fight it, use what happens.</p>

                <h3>Category2</h3>
                <p class="question">There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.</p>
                <p class="answer">You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Do an almighty painting with us. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.</p>
                <p class="question">I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.</p>
                <p class="answer">We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. It's cold, but it's beautiful. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. </p>
                <p class="question">Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?</p>
                <p class="answer">A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.</p>

                <p class="question">I'm a water fanatic. I love water.</p>
                <p class="answer">Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. This is unplanned it really just happens. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.</p>
                <p class="question">We forget the trees get lonely too.</p>
                <p class="answer">. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Work that paint. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents.</p>
                <p class="answer">Let your imagination be your guide. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Let's do that again. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. This is the fun part As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.</p>
