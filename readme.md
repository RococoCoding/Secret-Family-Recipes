# Secret Family Recipes  
**Timeline**: One week  
**Tech**: HTML, CSS  
**Description**: I want a place to store all my secret family recipes, handed down from generation to generation.  
**Contribution Type**: School Team Project - [Home page](https://github.com/RococoCoding/Secret-Family-Recipes/blob/main/index.html), [FAQ](https://github.com/RococoCoding/Secret-Family-Recipes/blob/main/faq.html)  
**Status**: Completed  
**Retrospective**: This was my first build week project at Lambda. I and another Unit 1 student built out the landing page using only HTML and CSS. This was a great exercise in working closely with a team member to ensure the pages we worked on matched in style. It would have been a lot easier if we had known about components and React, but we were able to keep each other well updated so it wasn't too bad. I think the biggest challenge was learning how to handle git when working with other people. We tried to keep it simple by separating the files we were working on, but we still had to figure out how to deal with conflicts.
