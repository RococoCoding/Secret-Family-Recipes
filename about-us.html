            (Talk about what the app does)In this world, everything can be happy. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.

            This is the way you take out your flustrations. Learn when to stop. Every day I learn. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.

            Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. You can create anything that makes you happy. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?
